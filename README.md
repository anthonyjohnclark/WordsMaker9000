# Wordsmaker9000

Welcome to **Wordsmaker9000**!

As a writer, I was sick of Word's overcomplicated interface and features I never used. I wanted a simple local desktop application that could save files to a project, word count, backup, simple rich text edit, auto-save, and more, in a style all my own. The biggest difference for me is having a VS Code like side-drawer with all my files in a project and being able to quickly switch between them.

More than that, I wanted more custom control over the AI prompts used to look at my writing.

It's a simple app, but it's mine!

## Configuring OPEN_AI Key

For OpenAI integrations:

1. **Obtain an API Key:**  
   Register at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and secure your API key.

2. **Set the API Key:**  
   Create a `.env` file in the project root (if itâ€™s not already present) and add:

   ```
   OPEN_AI_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key. Ensure this file is included in your `.gitignore` to protect your API credentials.

3. **Automatic Detection:**  
   The application automatically reads the `OPEN_AI_KEY` environment variable to enable OpenAI features.
